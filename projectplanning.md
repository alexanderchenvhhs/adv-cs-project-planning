# Advanced Topics in CS Project Planning

## Project idea

Create a simulated environment in which a user can modify variables and see how it affects objects in its population. The plan is to create a webpage that allows for a simulation that can be controlled with a basic UI and shows all statisics of the simulation at all times.

## Objectives

To see how specific variations in an environment can affect populations.
Create a basic project that allows for a basic understanding of managing a large number of variables and data at once.

## Methodology

Create individual objects which each have percent chances of events occuring. The simulation itself and outside factors that users can influence will change these chances and alter the properties of the objects.

## Resources required

A basic understanding of a coding language that can manage the data that the project wants to project.
A place to host the simulation that isn't resource intensive.
