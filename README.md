# OUTLINE

## 1. Problem Definition and Research Background
- Problem: how does adjusting individual or multiple vairables affect a simulated population and environment?
- Background: virtual simulated environments have existed for many years, allowing scientists to visualize data to predict or analyze behavior. The project aims to show an entry level concept for these kinds of simulations with easily controllable variables and understandable data.

## 2. AI Integration
- AI will NOT be used for this project. This is to make sure the creator will be able to fully understand and learn the concepts used to make this project.

## 3. Tasks & Timeline
- Tasks:
  - Learn JavaScript for the coding portion
  - Learn CSS and HTML to build the website to host the simulation
  - Develop what variables and data are required to make the simulation
  - Develop prototypes that run in console before trying to visualize it
- Timeline:
  - 1-2 months to learn JavaScript
  - 1 month to learn CSS/HTML
  - 1 month to make prototypes & plan the simulation itself
  - 1 month to create the final project

## 4. Documentation
- Biweekly updates will be posted in this Github in a branch specifically for this purpose.
- A seperate branch will hold all the code written for this project.
